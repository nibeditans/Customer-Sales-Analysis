# Customer-Sales-Analysis
For the Customer Sales Analysis project, I utilized Pandas and Matplotlib to conduct a comprehensive examination of sales data. My analysis began with essential data cleaning processes, including standardizing the order date and removing unnecessary columns. I performed some key analyses including: determining total sales per product, identifying top-selling products, analyzing sales trends over time (monthly and quarterly), and calculating the average order value per customer. The project included various visualizations, such as line charts for sales trends and bar charts for top products, to effectively communicate insights.

Here, I have added three files:

- [CSA (Jupyter Notebook)](https://github.com/nibeditans/Customer-Sales-Analysis/blob/main/Customer%20Sales%20Analysis.ipynb)
- [CSA (HTML Doc)](https://github.com/nibeditans/Customer-Sales-Analysis/blob/main/Customer%20Sales%20Analysis.html)
- [CSA (Python File)](https://github.com/nibeditans/Customer-Sales-Analysis/blob/main/Customer%20Sales%20Analysis.py)

You can check out the complete articles on this this Project: 

- [Customer Sales Analysis â€” Python Version](https://nsworldinfo.medium.com/customer-sales-analysis-python-version-part-1-60e5a50be351)
- [Customer Sales Analysis â€” SQL Version (Part-2)](https://nsworldinfo.medium.com/customer-sales-analysis-sql-version-part-2-648b9a15c184)


Whichever you're comfotable with, go and view that file. But I'll still suggest to view the Jupyter File, if you're viewing on github itself. If you want the HTML viewer, then download the file and do your analysis.

This work serves as a foundation for more advanced analyses in the improved version of the project. Please go and check the improved version of Customer Sales Analysis for more detailed and enhanced code and visualizations.
